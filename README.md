==================

Value by Alpha Election map with d3.js

The code herein describes how to create a "Value by Alpha" map. A thematic mapping technique that attempts to equalize the dominate visual variable; size, using partial opacities across classes.

The biggest take away is that you must create a basemap, then overlay the basemap using "fill-opacity" rather than rgba or rgb.
